"""
This file is a template for an ocean trajectory model
to be implemented within the OpenDrift framework.
To create a new model, make a copy (renamed) of this file, and
modify the class names and details below, according to the comments.
See e.g. module windblow.py for a minimalistic example.

For more help, see https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/wiki
or contact Knut-Frode Dagestad (knutfd@met.no)
For usage of the new model, see example scripts (e.g. example.py)

First we define an element type to be used by the trajectory model.
An element type (class) may also be imported/reused from
another module - see examples in the folder "elements"

        This function ("update", may not be renamed) defines
        the actions (processes) to be performed at each time step.
        The default timestep is one hour, but this may be overriden
        by the user (setting model.time_step, see e.g. example.py)

        The elements and corresponding environment information
        (wind, waves, current...) is available to this function as
        the recarrays "elements" and "environment", respectively.
        Element properties and environvent variables are namedarrays
        of same length (number of active particles), or scalars.

        E.g.:

        .. code::

            self.elements.z
            self.elements.mass
            self.environment.x_wind
            self.environment.y_wind

        E.g. to specify evaporation (mass reduction) proportional to wind speed:

        .. code::

            self.elements.mass = self.elements.mass - \
                np.sqrt(self.environment.x_wind**2 + \
                        self.environment.y_wind**2)*.01

        Horizontal position of the particles (lon, lat) are the
        only properties which should not be modified directly/freely.
        Due to the need to correct for the curvature of the coordinate
        systems, a dedicated function (self.update_positions() should be
        used instead, with x- and y-velocity as arguments:
        E.g. to simply move particles with ambient current:
        self.update_positions(self.environment.x_sea_water_velocity,
                              self.environment.y_sea_water_velocity)
        E.g. to move particles with 3 percent of the wind speed:

        .. code::

            wind_factor = 0.03

            self.update_positions(self.environment.x_wind*wind_factor,
                                self.environment.y_wind*wind_factor)

        If particles need to be deactived (e.g. when hitting land),
        the special function `self.deactivate_elements()` should be used:
        `self.deactivate_elements(self.environment.land_binary_mask==1)`
        """
        pass
