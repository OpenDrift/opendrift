History
=======

2025-10-22 / Release v1.14.4
----------------------------
* Fix for vertical mixing for backwards simulations
* Updates to OpenBerg, RadioNuclides and ChemicalDrift
* Fixed problem with deactivation of elements outside user-defined area
* More robust way to detect copernicus dataset_id (thx to Cruz Garcia)
* ROMS native reader better compatible with CROCO
* seed_from_geopandas (and seed_from_shapefile) can now take arguments with array length equal to number of elements.

2025-08-28 / Release v1.14.3
----------------------------
* Added two new oils to OpenOil / ADIOS: RINGHORNE 2025 and BALDER BLEND 2025
* Property opendrift.test_data_folder now replaces object method test_data_folder
* reader_ROMS_native:
  * Fix for non-CF-compliant Croco files and corresponding GRD-files
  * Removed gls_tke functionality, now found in new file legacy.py
* Several updates to OpenBerg module
* Vertical advection and mixing is disabled by default in OceanDrift (e.g. to prevent sinking of simulated surface drifters), but enabled in some sub-modules.
* General cleaning of main loop (run) in Basemodel class
* Environment variables and element properties with attribute ``store_previous=True`` are now available as ``self.environment_previos.<var>`` and ``self.elements_previous.<var>``. This replaces hardcoded solution for lon and lat only.
* New mechanism to skip environment variables based on conditional given in dictionary required_variables with key *skip_if*
* Conditional mechanism now also used to decide if previous value of element properties shall be stored
* reader_oscillating now takes period as timedelta instead of period_seconds as float.
* Two new (optional) corrections to compensate for vertical velocity (w) from ocean models being relative to fixed z=0, whereas z/depth in OpenDrift is relative to actual surface (zeta possibly nonzero): ``drift:water_column_stretching`` and ``drift:vertical_velocity_correction``. Of minior importance to most (3D) applications.
* Switching land and ocean colors if inverted shapefile (i.e. lake) is used for landmask. Also fixed indexing bug in algorithm to move land elements to water when using shapefile landmask.
* Several fixes to ``<reader>.plot()``
* ``opendrift_gui`` now takes ``--forcing`` as an optional commandline argument, for user defined file with list of forcing datasets
* Made fix and added test for export_variables. Thx to vincentcasseau for reporting.
* Extracted ``coastline_crossing`` from stranding algorithm as a separate method, which now also applies to ``previous`` and not only ``stranding``

2025-05-19 / Release v1.14.2
----------------------------
* Adding new oil TYRVING 2025

2025-05-19 / Release v1.14.1
----------------------------
* Relaxing 3rd party package requirements.
* Added two new config settings of OceanDrift and submodels (``drift:vertical_advection_at_surface`` and ``drift:vertical_mixing_at_surface``) to control whether vertical advection and mixing shall apply to elements at the very surface (z=0). Both are presently default False for OpenOil, but default True for other modules.

2025-05-15 / Release v1.14.0
----------------------------
* opendrift.open() now creates a lazy version of self.results dataset, for faster import of large files (Manuel Aghito and AI).
* In ``seed_elements``, number can now be a multiple of the number of positions. New parameter number_per_point is new alternative. seed_from_geopandas now supports GeoDataframes with either only points, or only polygons/multipolygons.
* Animation now plots drifter trajectory as connected to drifter position indicator.
* Opening up for netCDF>=1.7.2, but .netrc authentication will not work for thredds until libnetcdf 4.9.3 is out.
* Enabled Python 3.13 in CircleCI, and (temporarily) increased RMS threshold in map generation tests.
* Seeding from shapefiles is now based on geojson, as new dependency. Removed some redundancy with new method seed_from_geopandas, which is used by both seed_from_shapefile and seed_from_wkt. Shapefiles for seeding can now contain points or polygons/multipolygons, with lines (linearstring) planned for the future.
* Several Updates to ChemicalDrift and OpenBerg.
* Added Git to requrements (environment.yml) - for use when building Docker image.
* Updates to method to move elements seeded on land to closest point in ocean, based on vector landmask (Achim Randelhoff).
* Fixed bug that final global attributes were not written to file when number of output timesteps were larger than export_buffer_length.
* Fixed bug in methods sea_floor_depth and sea_surface_height in physics_methods module.
* New generic method ``pust_run`` that can be implemented in a module to be run after simulation (counterpart to ``prepare_run()``)
* SHYFEM reader can now also read variables with two dimensions (Angie-P)
* Fixed problem with reopening netCDF files after export on Windows.
* Bugfix in interact_with_seafloor: now taking sea_surface_elevation into account. Reported by Robert Hartmann.

2025-03-19 / Release v1.13.1
----------------------------
* netCDF readers: Making sure chunk size of time dimension is 1, by reopening dataset if necessary. This may have large impact on reader performance. Also Unifying chunks to avoid problems with mfdatasets with varying chunks.
* Added hack in ``reader_netCDF_CF_generic`` to deal with corrupted times (first and last) in NCEP winds on thredds
* OpenOil: allow providing json file or dictionary as ``oil_type`` argument to seed methods. Using keyword oiltype instead of oil_type now raises an error.
* Moved skillscore methods to independent package TrajAn. TrajAn now installed with pip directly from GitHub, to always use latest.
* Fixed bug due to mutating list of required variables when applying environmental_mappings.
* Project: remove poetry, use standard pyproject.toml. Using setuptools backend.
* Requiring copernicusmarine > 2.0. Specifying 'chunk_size_limit=0' to copernicusmarine.open_dataset() to avoid large performance drop due to default chunking of 50 along time.
* Internal element property ID is not starting from 0 and not 1. ID corresponds now to trajectory coordinate in ``self.result``

2025-02-11 / Release v1.13.0
----------------------------
* Major internal change: recarray ``self.history`` is replaced with Xarray dataset ``self.result``, with some minor API changes:

  * The method ``run()`` now returns a pointer to this dataset, i.e. one can type ``ds = o.run()``  and subsequently analyse the results with e.g. `TrajAn <https://opendrift.github.io/trajan/>`_. The plotting/analysis methods within OpenDrift works as before, but operates now on ``self.result`` instead of ``self.history``.
  * The method ``get_lonlats()`` has been removed, as one can now do simply ``self.result.lon`` to get longitude as an Xarray DataArray
  * The method ``get_property()`` is obsolete for the same reason. It now issues a warning that this method will be removed in the next version. New syntax is to use ``self.result.<property>`` where property is any element properties (lon, lat, status, length etc) or environment variables (wind, currents, ...), or coordinate variables ``time`` and  ``trajectory``
  * ``self.result.time`` is a numpy64 array, which can be converted to python datetime with ``pandas.to_datetime(self.result.time).to_pydatetime()``

    * ``get_time_array()`` issues a warning that it will soon be removed, in favor of above syntax.

  * Attribute ``self.steps_output`` is replaced by ``len(self.result.time)``
  * Removed methods ``opendrift.open_xarray`` and ``io_netcdf.import_file_xarrray``, as ``opendrift.open`` now also imports lazily with Xarray.

* Saved netCDF files are now compressed with Zlib level 6, and are typically 70% smaller than before.

  * Data types for all element properties and environment variables are consistently `numpy.float32` internally in OpenDrift, with the benfit of NaN as masked values.
  * In output netCDF files, element properties are encoded according to the attribute ``data_type`` as specified in the actual ElementType class.

* linewidth can be specified for animations, whenever trajectories are shown
* Generic netCDF reader and ROMS readers now use a new common method `reader.open_dataset_opendrift` to open Xarray dataset from files or URLS, and also decoding time.
* Dynamic detection of dimension order in generic reader also for split blocks for global readers. ReaderBlock also shifts x-coordinate for global readers. General improvements for global simulations crossing both dateline and 0-meridian.
* Reinserted hack to decode time in ROMS-croco files, which are not CF compatible
* Updated logging mechanism. Can now send log to both file and console.
* Replaced mambaforge with miniforge3 in circleCI config
* ``set_up_map`` now stores ``crs_plot`` and ``crs_lonlat`` for later user. Landmask is now obtained on Mercator/plot grid (and not lonlat-grid) when ``fast=True``
* Faster plotting:

  * Getting land polygons from roaring_landmask if full resolution coastline. Also clipping polygons to plot extent, and caching per extent. This gives large speedup, in particular for animations.
  * Using RoaringLandmask to check/screen if there is any land within plot area, otherwise skip plotting of vector coastline.

* Removed obsolete method ``wind_drift_factor_from_trajectory_lw``. Could eventually be rebuilt with/around TrajAn.
* Removed method ``disable_vertical_motion``
* Removed obsolete method ``ShipDrift.import_ascii_format``
* ``Leeway.export_ascii`` now limits to 5 decimals for longitudes and latitudes. Still some minor differences are sometimes seen in last decimal, thus there are two versions of output reference file in test suite.

----------------------------
* Raising now error if all elements are seeded on land

2024-06-25 / Release v1.11.7

* Model property reguired_profiles_z_range is now replaced with config setting drift:profile_depth, and profiles are retrieved from surface to this depth. profiles_depth is now input parameter to get_environment, and not anymore a property of Environment class. prepare_run must now always call prepare_run of parent class, since profile_depth is copied to object in basemodel.prepare_run
* get_variables_along_trajectory now also takes depth (z) as input parameter
* updates to wetting/drying in ROMS reader (Kristin Thyng)
* Fill value in output netCDF files is now set to NaN for floats and -999 for integers
* Moving basereader.prepare() to variables.prepare(), as the former was overriding structured.prepare() due to multiple inheritance, and thus config *drift:max_speed* was not applied if config setting was made after reader was added. Also increasing *drift:max_speed* of OceanDrift from 1 to 2m/s

* Added new oil, HEIDRUN AARE 2023 

2024-04-02 / Release v1.11.2
----------------------------
* Proper handling of sea_surface_height implemented by Kristin Thyng. All subclasses of OceanDrift now have `sea_surface_height` (default 0) as new parameter. z=0 is always sea surface (including sea_surface_height), and seafloor is now where z = -(sea_floor_depth + sea_surface_height)
* Improvements of ROMS reader by Kristin Thyng:

  * Roppy-method `sdepth` (used by ROMS reader) now accounts for `sea_surface_height` (zeta).
  * Improved handling of rotation of vectors.
  * Interpolator can be saved/cached to file to save time on repeated simulations.
  * Improved handling of landmasks, for wetting-drying-applications.

* Added alternative biodegradation to OpenOil by specifying half_tiome [days], which can be different for slick and submerged droplets.
* Memory usage is now logged once every timestep, and can be plotted after simulation with new method `o.plot_memory_usage()`
* Exporting directly to parquet file is now an alternative to netCDF (#1259, Achim Randelhoff)
* The size and color of particles of animation and animation_profile methods can now be scaled with any element or environment property by specifying marker=<property>. Sizes can eventually be scaled by spcifying markersize_scaling. Transparency (alpha) can also be provided. Some examples are updated.

* Bugfix for attibute of vertical coordinate in SCISM raeder (Calvin Quigley)
* Can make faster and smaller animation by selcting frames as range or list (Manuel Aghito)

2023-12-12 / Release v1.11.0
----------------------------

* Norwegian oil data (json files) are moved from OpenDrift repository to https://github.com/OpenDrift/noaa-oil-data, from where they are harvested to oils.xz.
* adios_db is new dependency, and old oil methods are removed from openoil.py and companion scripts.
* lazy_reader can now pass zarr auth info
* Renamed OpenBerg to OpenBergOld, to give place for a new full-fledged ice berg drift model which includes thermodynamics
* Order of initializing a simulation is now strict: configuration and adding readers must be done before seeding elements and starting simulation. Internally this is regulated by *modes*: ['Config', 'Ready', 'Run', 'Result'] and use of decorators for when methods are applicable.
* Related restructuring, including new Config and Environment classes, and renaming basemodel.py to basemodel/__init__.py. reset method is removed, and a clone method is intruduced instead.
* drift:max_speed is now a config value. fallback_values it not anymore a cached dict, but must be retrieved from config. Updated all examples and tests to seed elements after config and readers
* Several updates to ChemicalDrift module
* Fixed bug related to rotation of east/north-oriented vectors from reader_netCDF_generic with projection of different orientation
* Fixed bug for buffer size for negative time steps and readers with no time dimension
* dbyte type landmask now allowed in ROMS reader
* Removing u_eastward and v_northward from ROMS variable mappings, as these are wrongly rotated. Rotation should be fixed if these are re-inserted
* Readers are now quarantined/discarded if they fail more than the number of times given by config readers:max_number_of_fails (default 1)
* Added method plot_stokes_profile to plot vertical profiles of Stokes drift
* Added standard_name aliases for baroclinic_x_sea_water_velocity, baroclinic_eastward_sea_water_velocity, and y/north counterparts
* Added normal and lognormal droplet size distributions for subsea blowout (author Giles Fearon)
* Fixed bug for solar_coeff in sealice model (author Julien Moreau)
* vector_pairs_xy now also contains name of magnitude and direction_to components, i.e. 4 elements array (xname, yname, magnitude, direction_to). For future automatic conversion between x_comp,ycomp and speed,magnitude
* More generic environment mapping methods, from vectors to magnitude/direction and vice versa. Need improvement formapping based on other mapped variables. Readerinfo now use get_variables_interpolated_xy instead of get_variables to report data at point
* Fixed wrong distribution of angles when seeding with uniform distribution. Thanks to Oyvind Breivik for spotting.
* oil_type can be decided at first seeding, but not changed at second seeding. I.e. as before, only a single oil type can be used for a simulation.

* Leeway: number of elements now equal to length of lon,lat input array (if number not given).
* Leeway: ASCII output gives small numerical difference on different platforms, presumably because of numerical errors.
* Fixing bug in get_environment, where unmasked arrays of nan did not lead to call for more readers.
* Add trajan as dependency.

2022-11-16 / Release v1.10.4

2022-09-26 / Release v1.10.0
----------------------------
* OpenDrift and roaring-landmask is now available as conda packages in conda-forge.
* Roaring landmask is now the only standard landmask provider. The `extent` and corners arguments
  have been removed from the global_landmask reader. They have not been in use when roaring-landmask
  was installed.
* The land shapes included with roaring-landmask is used if full resolution is used during plotting. Otherwise the cartopy provider is used.
* `Two bugs in OpenOil fixed by Giles Fearon <https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/commit/78f2bd491ddc554d018e8527f97430211aafbba4>`__: in vertical mixing procedure, Temperature has wrong unit when calculating water density, and diameter was used instead of radius to calculate terminal velocity. This lead to moderate errors in vertical distribution of oil droplets: https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/commit/457ed0ff263fb2cd51125cbc3df8c972e0b16fe7
* Fixed offset error in plotting of background fields on animations, which arose due to recent updates of matplotlib.
* Added fix (suggested by user lyingTree) for problem when seeding small number of elements within polygons.
* `figsize` is new optional argument to plot and animation methods (default is 11 inches).
* Possible to specify custom title for animation method.
* Oil type is now retrieved from stored netCDF files from OpenOil simulations.
* Fixed bug for readers with property `always_valid=True`
* Added boolean option show_trajectories to `plot` method.
* `reader_netCDF_CF_generic` does now only detect 1D-variables as x- and y-coordinates.

* Variables may now also be specified for `add_readers_from_list`.
* Allowing more than one drifter-dictionary to be animated, if keyword `drifter` (previously named `trajectory_dict`)  is a list instead of dict.
* New convenience method for structured readers to calculate ocean depth, area and volume within given coordinates.
* Generic netCDF reader now raises an error of file/URL is (apparently) raw ROMS output.
* ROMS native reader is now not rotating vectors with east/north in either variable or standard-name.
* Updates to ROMS native reader: standard_name_mapping may be provided by user, and mask, coordinates and angle may all be read from eventual gridfile.
* Added option to chose ensemble member in `reader_netCDF_CF_generic` (by user `mateuszmatu`).
* An experimental drift model based on the Eulerian modeling scheme has been added.
* It is now possible to combine readers using operators, e.g. to take the mean of two readers, or tune the intensity of a variable. See the `example_reader_operators.py` for an example.


2022-03-18 / Release v1.9.0
---------------------------
* Now using Cartopy >= 0.20. Cartopy < 0.20 is longer supported.
* Updated thredds URL to Barents2.5 ocean model
* ROMS native reader now detects variables having standard_name attribute
* Using more explicit exceptions internally, e.g. OutsideSpatialCoverageError, CouldNotInitializeReaderError etc.

* roaring_landmask (written in Rust) is now installed as default (faster landmask checking)


2022-02-28 / Release v1.8.4
---------------------------
* Fixed discarding of irrelevant readers, which was not working properly. Readers are now discarded if they do not cover simuation temporal or spatial coverage, or do not contain relevant variables

* Fixed bug preventing export of final time step if the final time_step output is not completed
* Fixed bug in ShipDrift model: beta2 was not updated in loop, giving minor directional error
* Fixed bug in ShipDrift model: left and right directions were swapped

2022-01-31 / Release v1.8.3
---------------------------
* Removing duplicate oils in OpenOil

2022-01-31 / Release v1.8.2
---------------------------
* Re-inserted missing oil UTGARD CONDENSATE 2021, and added mapping from EKOFISK BLEND 2002 to 2000

2022-01-27 / Release v1.8.1
---------------------------
* Fixed bug in ShipDrift: erroneous direction used for wave forcing when Stokes drift was provided as forcing.
* New methods to calculate Liu-Weissberg and DARPA skillscores
* Blit is now an input parameter to animation, defaulting to False, as blitting destroys zorder (background field is always overlaid landmask)

2022-01-06 / Release v1.8.0
---------------------------
* The oil-library has been replaced with the new ADIOS database. Oils are
  retrieved from `adios.orr.noaa.gov <https://adios.orr.noaa.gov/>`_, but
  shipped with OpenDrift. They will be updated occasionally. Additional oils
  not yet included in ADIOS are also supplied with OpenDrift.
* A custom oil can be specified to OpenOil as a JSON string in the format of
  ADIOS. This means that if you want to use a new or updated oil from the ADIOS
  database, you can download it as JSON and specify it manually.
* The dependency on the oillibrary is now removed, and we should no longer have
  any conda-specific package dependencies.
* Faster writing of animations to file (mp4 and gif) using grab_frame and saving methods in matplotlib.animation writers

* OpenOil and PlastDrift now inherits ElementType class from OceanDrift, instead of from Elements.PassiveTracer
* Fixed `bug <https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/commit/7c49edaea55a65f3781363457b504c5dd86f55b2>`__ for vertical mixing with depths below 255m
* A new model :mod:`sealice <opendrift.models.sealice>` has been added, written by `Julien Moreau <https://github.com/Boorhin>`_.
* `Machine learning correction <https://opendrift.github.io/_modules/opendrift/models/oceandrift.html#OceanDrift.machine_learning_correction>`__ in OceanDrift model. Used for DARPA FFT Challenge, with machine learning data generated by Jean Rabault. Will be made avaiable for general use in future release.

2021-11-08 / Release v1.7.3
---------------------------
* reader_from_url is now using requests instead of urllib, fixing problem with add_readers_from_list and .netrc authentication.
* Hidden feature for ``reader_netCDF_CF_generic``: if attributes ``shift_x`` and ``shift_y`` are defined, the returned fields are shifted this many meters in the x/y (or east/north) directions
* parameter ``show_particles`` to plot() is now renamed to ``show_elements``, as for animation()
* Map bounds are now extended to cover also comparison simulations and any trajectory_dicts.
* ``skip`` and ``scale`` as input to plot() and animation() are now None, so that density and length and arrows are determined by matplotlib/quiver, unless overridden by user.
* New method (``distance_between_trajectories``) to calculate distances between two trajectories, position by position.
* Updates to ``ChemicalDrift`` model

2021-10-27 / Release v1.7.2
---------------------------

* Add method to retrieve environment variables (from given readers) along a given trajectory (e.g. a drifter).
* Improved dateline handling in readers.
* Fix dateline bug in landmask.
* ``reader_netCDF_CF_generic``: if x, and y-coordinates are integer sequences, these are not anymore interpreted as projection coordinates.
* ``reader_netCDF_CF_generic``: taking calendar name into acount when decoding time.
* Leeway model: max_speed is increased to 5 m/s, avoiding obtaining too small data-blocks readers.
* Leeway model ASCII export: if all elements are deactivated, write previous mean position, instead of NaN.
* Improved Xarray-postprocessing (based on `opendrift.open_xarray`), as demonstrated in ``example_river_runoff.py``. Aotomatic ``analysis_file`` is omitted.
* Fixed problem related to mutating dictionary of readers when discarding.
* Added ``mixed_layer_depth`` (default 50m) as environment variable of OceanDrift (and subclasses). This is used if ``Sundby`` or ``Large`` parameterizations of vertical turbulence is activated. A new config setting defines background diffusivity (default: ``1.2e-5 m2-s``)
* ``origin_marker_name`` can now be specified when seeding, and is stored as attributes ``flag_meanings`` to output variable ``origin_marker``.
* Quiver plots are now centered on pixels/grid, instead of at corner.

2021-09-01 / Release v1.7.1
---------------------------
* Using OilLibrary v4+noaa1.1.3

2021-08-30 / Release v1.7.0
---------------------------
* New method ``reader.shift_start_time(start_time)`` to shift time coverage of reader
* Density arrays calculated with method "get_density" for files opened with `open_xarray` can now be weighted with any property, or a user provided array. `origin_marker is now a dimension of the arrays stored in analysis netCDF file. Made new method `get_density_timeseries`
* ROMS native reader now accepts datasets where lon and lat are 1-dimensional
* Fixed bug related to extrapolating 3D data to seafloor
* Fixed bug with interpolation where latitude/y-coordinate is decreasing and not increasing (flipped upside down). Also fixed small inaccuracy of structured interpolation.
* Fixed horizontal diffusion for backwards simulations
* Enable the use of `roaring-landmask <https://github.com/gauteh/roaring-landmask>`_ as landmask reader, if installed.

2021-05-03 / Release v1.6.0
-----------------------------
* Reader environment mappings (deriving variables from others) can be activated with >>> o.activate_environment_mapping(<mapping_name>). Method to derive wind components from ``wind_speed`` and ``wind_from_direction / wind_to_direction`` is activated by default.
* New unstructured reader for SHYFEM model output
* ``animation`` and ``animation_profile`` methods may now use legend instead of colorbar for element properties
* Arguments ``color`` to ``animation()`` and ``linecolor`` to ``plot()`` can now be arrays of length equal to the number of elements.
* Improved mechanism for drifter/trajectory overlay on animations, as illustraded by :doc:`example_current_from_drifter <gallery/example_current_from_drifter>`
* Several improvements to module ChemicalDrift
* For PlastDrift model, config ``drift:vertical_mixing=False`` still gave vertical entrainment for ``mixingmodel=analytical``, but this is now changed. Sundby83 is now default model for vertical diffusivity in PlastDrift (was Large1994)
* Increased valid range of current velocity components from 10 m/s to 15 m/s
* Rotated pole projection (ob_tran) is now parsed from CF attributes by reader_netCDF_CF_generic.

* lon, lat are now positional arguments also in Leeway.seed_elements method. Leeway.seed_from_shapefile did nor work before this fix.
* Config option ``drift:lift_to_seafloor`` is replaced by ``general:seafloor_action``, analoguos to ``general:coastline_action``.
  Available options are ``none``, ``deactivate``, ``lift_to_seafloor`` as well as new option ``previous`` - moving elements back to previous position.
* New method ``get_trajectory_lengths`` to calculate length and speeds along trajectories
* Basemodel class does not anymore have a projection, internal coordinates are now always lon, lat
* Color of ocean and landmask may now be overridden in plot- and animation methods with new input variables ``land_color`` and ``ocean_color``. A new input dictionary ``text`` allows map annotations.
* opendrift-landmask-data only loads mask once for each python process, reducing memory usage and improves performance where you run opendrift multiple times in the same script and process.

2021-02-15 / Release v1.5.6
-----------------------------
* New parallelisation of lonlat2xy for unprojected readers. The flag ``<reader>.multiprocessing_fail`` is replaced with ``<reader>.__parallel_fail__``
* plot_property() can now save figure to file if filename is provided
* netCDF attribute seed_geojson is now a GeoJSON FeatureCollection.
* reader_netCDF_CF_generic does not anymore read 2D lon/lat variables if 1D x/y variables are detected, giving much faster initialisation.
* General replacement of ``np.float`` and ``np.int`` with either ``float``, ``int`` or ``np.float32/64`` and ``np.int32/64``. np.float and np.int are deprecated in numpy 1.20.
* Fixed bug occuring when interpolating environment_profiles in time, and the number of vertical layers in the ocean-model-block is larger at time1 than at time2

2021-01-26 / Release v1.5.5
---------------------------
* New module LarvalFish, for fish eggs hatching into larvae with swimming behaviour
* Sundby83 parameterisation of vertical diffusivity is now set to 0 below mixed layer depth (default 50m)

2021-01-04 / Release v1.5.0
---------------------------
* Major restructuring of Basereader class. Readers now are sublasses of Structured, Unstructured or Continuous.
* Built in GUI is improved with posibillity to adjust all config settings.
* Some Leeway parameters are renamed from camelCase to camel_case, including: ``jibeProbability`` -> ``jibe_probability`` and ``objectType`` -> ``object_type``
* Renamed config setting ``drift:scheme`` -> ``drift:advection_scheme``

2020-11-01 / Release v1.4.2
---------------------------

* Fixed bug in v1.4.1 that OpenOil and SedimentDrift had fallback_value of 0 for `land_binary_mask`, this shall be `None`.

2020-10-31 / Release v1.4.1
---------------------------

* Built in GUI is improved with docstrings and less hardcoding, based on new config mechanism, including a new bool setting ``seed:seafloor``.
* ``model.required_variables`` is now a dictionary, which also includes the earlier ``fallback_values``, ``desired_variables`` and ``required_profiles``. Instead of providing fallback values directly in a dictionary, these shall now be provided through the config mechanism: ``o.set_config('environment:fallback:<variable>', <value>)``. Correspondingly, config setting ``environment:constant:<variable>`` may be used to specify constant values for the same variables (overriding any other readers).
* `seed_elements <https://opendrift.github.io/autoapi/opendrift/models/basemodel/index.html#opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation.seed_elements>`_ is simplified, by factoring out a new method `seed_cone <https://opendrift.github.io/autoapi/opendrift/models/basemodel/index.html#opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation.seed_cone>`_

2020-10-27 / Release v1.4.0
---------------------------

* New internal config mechanism, and configobj package is no longer needed. The user API (``get_config()``, ``set_config()``) is unchanged, but model developers must use the `new mechanism <https://opendrift.github.io/autoapi/opendrift/models/basemodel/index.html#opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation._add_config>`_ to add configuration settings.
* Added new reader for static 2D fields (``reader_constant_2d.py``)
* Xarray, Dask and Xhistogram are new requirements. New method ``opendrift.open_xarray`` to open an output netCDF file lazily, with possibility to e.g. calculate density arrays/plots from datasets to large to fit in memory.
* New model chemicaldrift

2020-10-15 / Release v1.3.3
---------------------------

* New seed method ``seed_repeated_segment()``
* New method ``animate_vertical_distribution()``

* Vertical mixing is now disabled by default in OceanDrift, but enabled in all submodules (PelagicEggDrift, SedimentDrift, RadionuclideDrift, OpenOil)
* Vertical diffusivity option `zero` is replaced with ``constant``, which means using the fallback value.
* New config setting ``drift:horizontal_diffusivity``, providing time-step independent diffusion, in contrast to ``drift:current_uncertainty`` and ``drift:wind_uncertainty``
* Readers may be initialised from a JSON string, where `reader` is name of reader module, and other parameters are forwarded to reader constructor, e.g.: `{"reader": "reader_cmems", "dataset": "global-analysis-forecast-phy-001-024-hourly-t-u-v-ssh"}`
* CMEMS reader now obtains username/password from .netrc instead of environment variables. CMEMS-motuclient is added to environment.yml
* CMEMS reader now takes dataset name and not product name as input, and it is possible to provide variable mapping.
* NOAA ADIOS is now default (and only) option for oil weathering, as the "built in" oil weathering module ("basic") is removed.
* GUI is generalised, to be usable for any modules. This includes taking default seed options from `config:seed:` (e.g. m3_per_hour for OpenOil)

---------------------------

* Fixed ``vmax`` value for animations with density array

* nc-time-axis is new dependency, providing support for cftime axis in matplotlib

2020-07-03 / Release v1.3.1
---------------------------

* NOAA oil weathering model is now default choice in OpenOil
* Bugfix in reader_netCDF_CF_generic for particles with negative longitudes combined with global datasets with longitudes from 0-360

  * Tkalich(2002) entrainment rate

  * Exponential droplet size distribution

* Renamed two config settings:

  * ``processes:turbulentmixing`` -> ``drift:vertical_mixing``

  * ``processes:verticaladvection``-> ``drift:vertical_advection``

2020-06-24 / Release v1.3.0
------------------------------
* OceanDrift3D and OpenDrift3D have been merged into OceanDrift, and OpenOil3D has been merged into OpenOil. Thus OpenOil and OceanDrift are now 3D modules, but can still be configured for 2D drift.

2020-06-12 / Release v1.2.3
---------------------------

* Seed from shapefile: GDAL (ogr / osr) changed coordinate order, updates dependencies and call.

* Drop rasterio dependency and include some significant thread-safety fixes for landmask-data.

2020-05-14 / Release v1.2.1
---------------------------

* Specifying a positive time step with a negative duration is now an error. Duration should
  always be specified positive.

---------------------------

* Basemap reader and basemap plotting removed
* Minor improvements and bug fixes
* Example scripts are now available in online :doc:`gallery <gallery/index>`

---------------------------

* Cartopy is used for plotting (with fast option only using raster, see :meth:`opendrift.models.basemap.plot`)
* GSHHS full is used for a dedicated landmask reader (using full resolution always, possibly to :mod:`only use mask <opendrift.readers.reader_global_landmask>` for faster simulations)
* New documentation at https://opendrift.github.io
* Conda packages at https://anaconda.org/OpenDrift/repo
* Pypi packages
* OilLibrary also ported to Python 3
