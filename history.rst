History
=======

2024-04-02 / Release v1.11.2
----------------------------
* Proper handling of sea_surface_height implemented by Kristin Thyng. All subclasses of OceanDrift now have `sea_surface_height` (default 0) as new parameter. z=0 is always sea surface (including sea_surface_height), and seafloor is now where z = -(sea_floor_depth + sea_surface_height)
* Improvements of ROMS reader by Kristin Thyng:
  * Roppy-method `sdepth` (used by ROMS reader) now accounts for `sea_surface_height` (zeta).
  * Improved handling of rotation of vectors.
  * Interpolator can be saved/cached to file to save time on repeated simulations.
  * Improved handling of landmasks, for wetting-drying-applications.
* Added alternative biodegradation to OpenOil by specifying half_tiome [days], which can be different for slick and submerged droplets.
* Memory usage is now logged once every timestep, and can be plotted after simulation with new method `o.plot_memory_usage()`
* Exporting directly to parquet file is now an alternative to netCDF (#1259, Achim Randelhoff)
* The size and color of particles of animation and animation_profile methods can now be scaled with any element or environment property by specifying marker=<property>. Sizes can eventually be scaled by spcifying markersize_scaling. Transparency (alpha) can also be provided. Some examples are updated.
* Bugfix for cases with no active particles at the same timestep as exporting to file (#1251, Lenny Hucher)
* Bugfix for attibute of vertical coordinate in SCISM raeder (Calvin Quigley)
* Can make faster and smaller animation by selcting frames as range or list (Manuel Aghito)
* Updates to reader_netCDF_CF_generic:
  * Now also rotating ensemble vectors from east/north to x/y
  * Now using dynamic instead of hardcoded order of dimensions
  * Removing unnecessary ensemble dimension for seafloor depth
* Now ending timer[total time] before finalizing output netCDF file, so that complete performance is included.

2024-01-25 / Release v1.11.1
----------------------------
* ROMS reader can take xarray datasets (Rich Signell)
* Norwegian oils: maximum water fractions are overriden with Sintef values.
* set_config can take dictionary as input for faster setting of multiple options.
* New example to illustrate new Copernicus Marine Client.

2023-12-12 / Release v1.11.0
----------------------------

* Norwegian oil data (json files) are moved from OpenDrift repository to https://github.com/OpenDrift/noaa-oil-data, from where they are harvested to oils.xz.
* adios_db is new dependency, and old oil methods are removed from openoil.py and companion scripts.
* lazy_reader can now pass zarr auth info
* Renamed OpenBerg to OpenBergOld, to give place for a new full-fledged ice berg drift model which includes thermodynamics
* Order of initializing a simulation is now strict: configuration and adding readers must be done before seeding elements and starting simulation. Internally this is regulated by *modes*: ['Config', 'Ready', 'Run', 'Result'] and use of decorators for when methods are applicable.
* Related restructuring, including new Config and Environment classes, and renaming basemodel.py to basemodel/__init__.py. reset method is removed, and a clone method is intruduced instead.
* drift:max_speed is now a config value. fallback_values it not anymore a cached dict, but must be retrieved from config. Updated all examples and tests to seed elements after config and readers
* Several updates to ChemicalDrift module
* Fixed bug related to rotation of east/north-oriented vectors from reader_netCDF_generic with projection of different orientation
* Fixed bug for buffer size for negative time steps and readers with no time dimension
* dbyte type landmask now allowed in ROMS reader
* Removing u_eastward and v_northward from ROMS variable mappings, as these are wrongly rotated. Rotation should be fixed if these are re-inserted
* Readers are now quarantined/discarded if they fail more than the number of times given by config readers:max_number_of_fails (default 1)
* Added method plot_stokes_profile to plot vertical profiles of Stokes drift
* Added standard_name aliases for baroclinic_x_sea_water_velocity, baroclinic_eastward_sea_water_velocity, and y/north counterparts
* Added normal and lognormal droplet size distributions for subsea blowout (author Giles Fearon)
* Fixed bug for solar_coeff in sealice model (author Julien Moreau)
* vector_pairs_xy now also contains name of magnitude and direction_to components, i.e. 4 elements array (xname, yname, magnitude, direction_to). For future automatic conversion between x_comp,ycomp and speed,magnitude
* More generic environment mapping methods, from vectors to magnitude/direction and vice versa. Need improvement formapping based on other mapped variables. Readerinfo now use get_variables_interpolated_xy instead of get_variables to report data at point
* Fixed wrong distribution of angles when seeding with uniform distribution. Thanks to Oyvind Breivik for spotting.
* oil_type can be decided at first seeding, but not changed at second seeding. I.e. as before, only a single oil type can be used for a simulation.

2023-05-02 / Release v1.10.7
----------------------------
* CF projection info is now parsed with pyproj.CF.from_cf()

* Leeway: number of elements now equal to length of lon,lat input array (if number not given).
* Leeway: ASCII output gives small numerical difference on different platforms, presumably because of numerical errors.
* Fixing bug in get_environment, where unmasked arrays of nan did not lead to call for more readers.
* Add trajan as dependency.

----------------------------
* OpenDrift and roaring-landmask is now available as conda packages in conda-forge.
* Roaring landmask is now the only standard landmask provider. The `extent` and corners arguments
  have been removed from the global_landmask reader. They have not been in use when roaring-landmask
  was installed.
* The land shapes included with roaring-landmask is used if full resolution is used during plotting. Otherwise the cartopy provider is used.
* `Two bugs in OpenOil fixed by Giles Fearon <https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/commit/78f2bd491ddc554d018e8527f97430211aafbba4>`__: in vertical mixing procedure, Temperature has wrong unit when calculating water density, and diameter was used instead of radius to calculate terminal velocity. This lead to moderate errors in vertical distribution of oil droplets: https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/commit/457ed0ff263fb2cd51125cbc3df8c972e0b16fe7
* Fixed offset error in plotting of background fields on animations, which arose due to recent updates of matplotlib.

* New convenience method for structured readers to calculate ocean depth, area and volume within given coordinates.
* Generic netCDF reader now raises an error of file/URL is (apparently) raw ROMS output.
* ROMS native reader is now not rotating vectors with east/north in either variable or standard-name.
* Updates to ROMS native reader: standard_name_mapping may be provided by user, and mask, coordinates and angle may all be read from eventual gridfile.
* Added option to chose ensemble member in `reader_netCDF_CF_generic` (by user `mateuszmatu`).
* An experimental drift model based on the Eulerian modeling scheme has been added.
* It is now possible to combine readers using operators, e.g. to take the mean of two readers, or tune the intensity of a variable. See the `example_reader_operators.py` for an example.


2022-03-18 / Release v1.9.0
---------------------------
* Now using Cartopy >= 0.20. Cartopy < 0.20 is longer supported.

2022-01-27 / Release v1.8.1
---------------------------
* Fixed bug in ShipDrift: erroneous direction used for wave forcing when Stokes drift was provided as forcing.
* New methods to calculate Liu-Weissberg and DARPA skillscores
* Blit is now an input parameter to animation, defaulting to False, as blitting destroys zorder (background field is always overlaid landmask)

2022-01-06 / Release v1.8.0
---------------------------
* The oil-library has been replaced with the new ADIOS database. Oils are
  retrieved from `adios.orr.noaa.gov <https://adios.orr.noaa.gov/>`_, but
  shipped with OpenDrift. They will be updated occasionally. Additional oils
  not yet included in ADIOS are also supplied with OpenDrift.

* parameter ``show_particles`` to plot() is now renamed to ``show_elements``, as for animation()
* Map bounds are now extended to cover also comparison simulations and any trajectory_dicts.
* ``skip`` and ``scale`` as input to plot() and animation() are now None, so that density and length and arrows are determined by matplotlib/quiver, unless overridden by user.
* New method (``distance_between_trajectories``) to calculate distances between two trajectories, position by position.

* ``reader_netCDF_CF_generic``: taking calendar name into acount when decoding time.
* Leeway model: max_speed is increased to 5 m/s, avoiding obtaining too small data-blocks readers.
* Leeway model ASCII export: if all elements are deactivated, write previous mean position, instead of NaN.
* Improved Xarray-postprocessing (based on `opendrift.open_xarray`), as demonstrated in ``example_river_runoff.py``. Aotomatic ``analysis_file`` is omitted.
* Fixed problem related to mutating dictionary of readers when discarding.
* Added ``mixed_layer_depth`` (default 50m) as environment variable of OceanDrift (and subclasses). This is used if ``Sundby`` or ``Large`` parameterizations of vertical turbulence is activated. A new config setting defines background diffusivity (default: ``1.2e-5 m2-s``)
* ``origin_marker_name`` can now be specified when seeding, and is stored as attributes ``flag_meanings`` to output variable ``origin_marker``.

  Available options are ``none``, ``deactivate``, ``lift_to_seafloor`` as well as new option ``previous`` - moving elements back to previous position.
* New method ``get_trajectory_lengths`` to calculate length and speeds along trajectories
* Basemodel class does not anymore have a projection, internal coordinates are now always lon, lat
* Color of ocean and landmask may now be overridden in plot- and animation methods with new input variables ``land_color`` and ``ocean_color``. A new input dictionary ``text`` allows map annotations.
* opendrift-landmask-data only loads mask once for each python process, reducing memory usage and improves performance where you run opendrift multiple times in the same script and process.

2021-02-15 / Release v1.5.6

2020-10-31 / Release v1.4.1
---------------------------

* Built in GUI is improved with docstrings and less hardcoding, based on new config mechanism, including a new bool setting ``seed:seafloor``.
* ``model.required_variables`` is now a dictionary, which also includes the earlier ``fallback_values``, ``desired_variables`` and ``required_profiles``. Instead of providing fallback values directly in a dictionary, these shall now be provided through the config mechanism: ``o.set_config('environment:fallback:<variable>', <value>)``. Correspondingly, config setting ``environment:constant:<variable>`` may be used to specify constant values for the same variables (overriding any other readers).
* `seed_elements <https://opendrift.github.io/autoapi/opendrift/models/basemodel/index.html#opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation.seed_elements>`_ is simplified, by factoring out a new method `seed_cone <https://opendrift.github.io/autoapi/opendrift/models/basemodel/index.html#opendrift.models.basemodel.OpenDriftSimulation.seed_cone>`_

2020-10-27 / Release v1.4.0
---------------------------

* Drop rasterio dependency and include some significant thread-safety fixes for landmask-data.

2020-05-14 / Release v1.2.1
---------------------------

* Specifying a positive time step with a negative duration is now an error. Duration should
  always be specified positive.
