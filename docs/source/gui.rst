Graphical User Interface
========================

OpenDrift comes with a basic Graphical User Interface, which can be started with the command:

.. code::

   $ opendrift_gui.py

given that the `scripts-folder <https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/tree/master/opendrift/scripts>`_ is added to your PATH-variable. Otherwise, the command `$ python opendrift_gui.py`
should be run from within the scripts-folder. On Windows, the opendrift_gui.py script may be launched by a double-click.

Choosing a model and object/oiltype
-----------------------------------
Presently, only the :mod:`Leeway model (Search and Rescue) <opendrift.models.leeway>`, :mod:`OpenOil (oil drift) <opendrift.models.openoil>` and :mod:`ShipDrift model <opendrift.models.ShipDrift>` are available in the GUI.

The first step is to select the model of interest from the upper menu.
If Leeway or OpenOil are chosen, the second dropdown-meny will allow to select either
  * an oiltype (from `NOAA OilLibrary <https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/OilLibrary>`_), or
  * a `Leeway object category <https://www.dropbox.com/s/d5jhwo6y5zldxgh/Drivbanehjelp.pdf?raw=1>`_.

If the ShipDrift model is selected, the dimensions of the ship can be selected (beam, length, draft and height).

The following steps are the same for all models:

Seeding of particles
--------------------
* Choose a start point for the seeding (initialisation) of particles. Latitude and longitude must be given in decimal degrees, and negative longitudes correspond to west of Greenwich.
* The radius is an uncertainty radius (standard deviation, given in meters) around the given location within which all the (5000) elements will be seeded.
* Optional:

  * the end time can be changed if a continuous release of particles over a time span is desired, simulating e.g. a leaking well,
  * the end position can be changed if particles shall be released between the start and end positions, simulating e.g. a ship track.
  * or a combination of both.

* Note that whenever the start position or time is updated, the end position/time will be copied/overwritten.
* By clicking ``Check seeding`` it is possible to see a plot of the seedig positions before the simulation is started. Note that it takes about 5 seconds to generate this plot, and even 30 seconds if full resolution coastline is chosen.

Simulation time
---------------
* Simulations may by run forwards or backwards (backtracking, to check from where the object or oil has drifted)
* The simulation duration is given in hours. Note that simulations longer than 100 hours may take significant time (> 10 minutes), especially for oil drift.

Forcing data
------------
The sources used for current, wind and waves are given in `this list <https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift/blob/master/opendrift/scripts/data_sources.txt>`_, in prioritized order.
The forcing data are obtained/downloaded from remote servers (Thredds, OPeNDAP) during the simulation, and has global coverage, but high resolution for the North Atlantic only.
Possibility to modify/configure the forcing data is planned for the near future.

Whenever wave data is not available, OpenDrift will calculate wave parameters from wind.

Simulation and analysis
-------------------------
* The simulation is started by clicking ``START``

* The simulation will take from less than a minute for a short (12 hours) Leeway simulation and up to 10 minutes or more for a long (100 hours) oil drift simulation. Oil drift simulations takes more time due to heavy vertical turbulence calculations.

  * A progress-bar is not yet available in the GUI, but is planned for the near future.
  * It is presently not possible to stop an ongoing simulation, except for using a task manager (or `kill` command in Linux). The user interface is also unresponsive during the simulation.

* After the simulation, the result may be analysed with buttons appearing at the bottom:

  * ``Animation``: an animation of the simulation is shown or saved to file.
  * ``Oil budget`` (oil drift only): the time-history of the :mod:`oil budget <opendrift.models.openoil>` is shown or saved to file.
  * MET Norway only: a button ``Show in Diana`` will launch the Diana analysis tool.

    * Note that this is local Diana, not VGL-version.
    * The present and previous simulations may be viewed by opening ``Felter -> Drivbane_OpenDrift`` and then selecting ``Leeway``, ``Oljedrift`` or ``ShipDrift``. Note that the simulations will be sorted by the starting-time of the simulations, not the time at which the simulation was performed. Thus if you performed a simulation starting back in time, it might not be the last item in the list (`Referansetid`). Click on all the items in felter (submerged, stranded, surface), and then `Utf√∏r`. For oil drift simulations, submerged particles are blue, surface oil is grey or black.
